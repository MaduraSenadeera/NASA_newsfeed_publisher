# NASA Newsfeed Publisher

Python code utilising RSS feeds from NASA to summaries the categories of "Image of the Day", "Educational News", "Earth News", "Shuttle News" and "Solar System News".

From the selected few, the UI contains a button that allows the generation of a webpage with the most up-to-date stories from each of the topics.
