# NASA Newsfeed Publisher

Unofficially named the NASA Bulletin

Python code utilising RSS feeds from NASA to summaries the categories of "Breaking News", "Image of the Day", "Educational News", "Earth News", "Shuttle News" and "Solar System News". Code allows the use of a UI that the user is able to interact with to select which specific news topics they wish to view. From the selected few, the UI contains a button that allows the generation of a webpage with the most up-to-date stories from each of the topics.

This program requires Python 2 to run.
